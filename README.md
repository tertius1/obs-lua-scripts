## My lua plugin(s) for OBS

1. create-animated-gif.lua

   This script will start an external ffmpeg to extract a section of the recorded video and export this as animated
   gif or mp4/webm video snippet.

2. If you want to create a gif with alpha channels/transparency, set these settings in OBS ![image](https://github.com/g-l-i-t-c-h-o-r-s-e/obs-lua-scripts/assets/17163949/b5e5d534-d6fe-4688-93c5-becc54bc4ab9)
